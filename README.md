## About

Product Engineer with a design background and recent Cornell CS graduate. I specialize in building consumer products at the intersection of design and engineering.

Currently building a suite of consumer apps through Carbon Studio while helping companies launch their MVPs.

## What I'm Building

**[Carbon Studio](https://carbonstudio.xyz)** is a technology studio that crafts consumer apps and helps companies build their consumer MVPs. We're not a creative agency — we're a fullstack development studio that builds and launches our own suite of consumer products users fall in love with. We also partner with ambitious companies to take their ideas from MVP to market-ready scale.
